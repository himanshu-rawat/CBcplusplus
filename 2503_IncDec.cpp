// INCREASING DECREASING SEQUENCE
// Take the following as input.

// A number (N)
// Take N more numerical inputs
// The N inputs for a sequence S = s1, s2, .., sN. Compute if it is possible to split sequence into two sequences -
// s1 to si and si+1 to sN such that first sequence is strictly decreasing and second is strictly increasing. Print true/false as output.


// Constraints:
// 0 < N < 1000 
// Each number in sequence S is > 0 and < 1000000000

// Sample Input:
// 5 
// 1 
// 2 
// 3 
// 4 
// 5
// Sample Output:
// true
// Explanation:
// Carefully read the conditions to judge which all sequences may be valid. Don't use arrays or lists.
